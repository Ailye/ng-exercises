## Assignment 6

Add a Form with the following Inputs (and Validators):
- Mail address (should not be empty and should be an email address)
- A Dropdown which allows the user to select from three different Subscriptions ("Basic", "Advanced", "Pro"). Set "Avanced" as Default.
- A Password field (should not be empty)
- A Submit Button

Display a warning message if the Form is invalid AND was touched. Display a warning message below each input if it's invalid.

Upon submitting the form, you should simply print the Value of the Form to the Console.
Optionally, display it in your template.
